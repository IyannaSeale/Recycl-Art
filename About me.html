<h1> About me</h1>

<div class="bodyformat">
<p> I'm Iyanna. I live in Saint Lucia.
Art is one of the things that I am really passionate about.
I love to draw and paint. I am also very passionate about the
environment and I believe that we should take care of the earth.
One way that we can take care of the earth is through recycling.
So, I wanted to fuse the two things that I am passionate about
to help save the earth.

Here is one of my art pieces:
