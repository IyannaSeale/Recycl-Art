<h1> How Does It Work?</h1>
</div class="headers">

<div class="bodyformat">
<p> As previously mentioned, this project will turn municipal solid waste into art.
  People of all ages will fill out the form in the "Get Started" section of this website.
  After the form is reviewed, we will send special Recycl-Art bags that they are to place
  the waste from the project into. The waste being put into the bags can come from either
  their homes, workplaces or can be picked up from a littered area. Food and other
  biodegradables are not to be placed in these bags. The bags will also be recycled and used
  in the art to be made. </p>

<p>
  The person will then call or email Recycl-Art and our workers will come via truck to pick
  the bags up and transport them to Recycl-Art's building. For every piece of trash sent in,
  the sender will receive $0.20, which they will be able to collect at the Recycl-Art building.
</p>
<br>
<p>
 When the bags get to the building, they will be taken to the processing department where
 their contents will be cleaned, disinfected and sorted based on colour. The creative design team
 will come up with art piece ideas based on the trash received and these ideas will be posted to the
 website's "Projects" page.

Senders will receive emails and notifications from the site to alert them about when the trash
 can be put together. On a specific day, senders will come to the Recycl-Art building to work together
 as teams on putting together the trash into the design that the team came up with.
